## PatchMatrix

### a JACK patchbay in flow matrix style

A simple graphical JACK patchbay that tries to unite the best of both worlds:

* Fast patching and uncluttered port representation of a **matrix patchbay**
* Excellent representation of signal flow of a **flow canvas patchbay**

It additionally features tightly embedded graphical mixer clients automatable
with JACK MIDI/OSC.

#### Automation

##### MIDI

PatchMatrix mixer clients (AUDIO + MIDI) each have an additional JACK MIDI
automation port through which users can automate mixer matrix gains sample-accurately.

Currently, users have to send multiple MIDI messages for a single gain change
in a stateful transactional manner.

* NRPN-LSB: set index of sink port column (optional)
* NRPN-MSB: set index of source port row (optional)
* DATA-LSB: set lower 7 bits of gain (optional)
* DATA-MSB: set higher 7 bits of gain (mandatory)

DATA-MSB finalizes one transaction and sets gain to new value for currently
set sink/source port indexes.

##### OSC

PatchMatrix mixer clients (AUDIO + MIDI) additionaly support JACK OSC
automation through which users can automate mixer matrix gains sample-accurately.

    /patchmatrix/mixer iif (source index) (sink index) (gain in mBFS [-3600,3600])
